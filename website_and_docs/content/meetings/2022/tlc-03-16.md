Meetings are happening on the `#selenium-tlc` channel on [Selenium Slack](https://selenium.dev/support).

## Agenda
* Release Process Documented + Access 
  * Ruby — Documented; Titus, Alex, Diego 
  * Python — Documented; David, Diego, Titus 
  * Java — ??; Diego 
  * .NET — Not Documented; Jim 
  * JS — ??; David, Diego(?)
* Chrome Version Support — need patch releases 
  * Ruby — through v99 
  * Python — through v99 
  * JS — through v98(?)
  * Java — through v97 
  * .NET — through v96 
* Selenium 4.2 
  * Log JWP Deprecation in Java/Grid (PR 10408)
  * Blog Post / Links for JWP Deprecation in Java/Grid 
  * Add fully featured scroll() method in each bindings 
  * Add scrolling tests/examples for each bindings (PR  10445)
  * Additional PRs — 10438,  10433 
* Selenium 4.3 
  * Remove deprecated JWP Python code 
  * Ruby needs to get options better aligned with the rest of the bindings 
  * Remove constructors for local drivers deprecated in Se 3.6  (PR 10427)
  * Start removing Protocol conversion code from the grid. I think we would ideally figure out how to continue supporting Java bindings sending JWP code to Chrome (the way the rest of the bindings did before 4.0), but maybe that isn’t necessary
